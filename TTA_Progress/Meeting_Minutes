- Two members from our team met from 11am - 2pm to revise Sprint Planning. During this time the focus was to review the project's main idea, download the platforms necessary to open Jarvis-on-messenger in local interfaces, and to plan the 2 Sprint to accommodate for spring break.
- Two members from our team also met with Professor Juan in the TTA from 2pm - 4pm. For the first 60 minutes the team discussed possible sprint issues, how to scope down the project, and how to realistically approach our intended idea.
- During the last 60 minutes of the TTA, the team worked on cloning the Jarvis-on-Messenger github as a way to fork and later upload possible changes. The readme, TTA_Progress folder. and accompaning files were made.

Today I tried opening jarvis after updating the Requirement.txt because I noticed that a variety of different packages were outdated.
Since last Friday, we compared the packages from the forked Jarvis-on-messenger repository with updated ones from a pull request on the original
Jarvis-on-messenger repository from user/Swapagerwal. 
These new requirements work better and install onto our local pycharm ide.

PROBLEM:
After failing to run the "python Jarvis.py" command in the pycharm terminal, I analyzed the error messages, 
"Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "C:\Users\nfuen034\PycharmProjects\TTA-Learning-Through-Jarvis\jarvis.py", line 8, in <module>
    import modules
  File "C:\Users\nfuen034\PycharmProjects\TTA-Learning-Through-Jarvis\modules\__init__.py", line 10, in <module>
    from src import *
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'src'         "

SOLUTION:
The modules directory in this project/repository does in fact include a src directory that holds python files with the names of the possible
queries to use with the application.
  - My fix was to change the code in the "__init__.py" file that is inside the modules directory. The original said "import modules" (line 9)
and "from src import *" (line 10), but I felt that line 9 was the problem because \modules's import clearly wasn't accounting for src. I made
the following change: remove both lines 9 & 10, add at line 9 "from modules import *"

This allowed me to run the "python jarvis.py" command successfully, and it worked to show me the hello page on a local host page!
